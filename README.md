# Among Us Discord Bot

## About
This discord bot simply mutes/un-mutes everyone in the voice chat it is called from.
This allows fellow Among Us try-hards to grind.

## Usage
"$mute" or simply "$m" to mute everyone in the voice chat and "$unmute" or "$um" to un-mute.

Members with the role "CrewMod" can call this bot. All admins are "CrewMod"s by default.
